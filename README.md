## "What's in this repository?"

This is a minimalistic template repository for creating online courses in higher education created for the [DiLER](https://diler-digitell.github.io/examples.html) (Digital Literacy for Empirical Research) project, financed by [DigiTeLL](https://www.uni-frankfurt.de/106198465/Digital_Teaching_and_Learning_Lab___DigiTeLL) (Goethe-University Frankfurt).

We will use this template for creating a course website in the workshop "Openness in the Higher Education Classroom" in the group session on “Working collaborative with Jupyter Book: An open-source tool to create open and flexible teaching/learning materials”, June 2025.

Find more on how to utilizie this resource on the corresponding group session website: https://luciebinder.github.io/ws-openness-2025/general-information/index.html
or in the more detailed online tutorial [Creating interactive content with Jupyter Books](https://diler-digitell.github.io/Jupyter-Book).

Examples of how these courses could look:

- [Course for digital literacy](https://diler-digitell.github.io/DiLER_digital_literacy_course/)
*In today's digital world, it is essential to have a basic understanding of the technologies and tools that we use on a daily basis. This course is designed to give you an overview of the most important concepts and skills in digital literacy.*
